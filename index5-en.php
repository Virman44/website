<p> • <strong> “Cat service": </strong> Oscar Gustav Reilander - one of the first people to take an art photograph - in the absence of an exposure meter (a device that determines the exposure time) used for the same purpose ... his cat! It was with the help of the animal that he determined the degree of illumination in the studio - and, as a result, the exposure time. To do this, he looked at the pupils of the cat when it was in the studio: if they were greatly expanded, the shutter speed had to be slower; if the pupils were compressed into narrow slots, a short shutter speed was needed. </p>
 <p> • <strong> "View from the window": </strong> Joseph Nieps was the first to fix the image on the photo in 1826. The exposure of this picture lasted 8 hours and it was called "View from the window." </p>
 <p> • <strong> “Pigeon-photographer”: </strong> everyone probably heard that pigeons were used as postmen, but not everyone knows that pigeons also “worked” as photographers at the beginning of the 20th century. For the first time, a patent for the use of a pigeon for carrying a camera was received in 1908 by Julius Neubronner, a German by birth. But, nevertheless, there is no information about the use of pigeons in the First World War, but in the Second World pigeons, trained for aerial photography, were used by the French, Americans and Germans. Evidence of this can be considered a German toy of those times - a soldier who releases a dove with a camera. </p>
 <p> • <strong> "Einstein’s joke": </strong> when mentioning the name of Albert Einstein, almost everyone recalls the famous photograph of a brilliant physicist with his tongue sticking out. But few people know that this photo was taken in 1951 on his own birthday. And after Einstein saw his photo, he, like a true genius, did not hide it to hell (as any ordinary person would do), but also presented the popular presenter Howard Smith, writing on the back: “You will like this gesture, because it is for all of humanity. ” There is another version about this photo: once correspondents were so tired of Einstein with their requests to show a cheerful smile that the genius decided, to the surprise of the journalists, to show them the language. </p>
 <p> • <strong> "Underwater photo shoot": </strong> the first underwater photo (albeit of very poor quality) was taken back in 1856 by William Thompson. This camera was installed at the bottom near Weimont in the UK. </p>
 <p> • <strong> "Scout Edith": </strong> during the German occupation, Edith Piaf performed in prison camps in Germany. After the concert, she usually took pictures with German officers and prisoners of war themselves as a keepsake, after which, in Paris, the faces of the captives were cut from photographs and pasted into fake passports. When Piaf returned to the camps on a return visit, she secretly gave passports to prisoners of war, with the help of which many of them managed to escape. </p>
 <p> • <strong> Asphalt Paper: </strong> few people know that the first photo paper was made from ... asphalt! To be more precise, asphalt varnish was simply applied to a copper or glass plate - resulting in a prototype of modern photo paper. </p>
 <p> • <strong> "The severity of art": </strong> these photos now weigh almost nothing, and if they are on a flash drive in electronic form - even more so. But it was not always like that. It turns out that the first roller cassette (one of the prototypes of modern film) weighed 15 kilograms! Perhaps you think that it would make VERY many pictures? Not at all - out of 15 kilograms of photosensitive paper in a roll cassette, only ... 12 photos could turn out! </p>
 <p> • <strong> "Mountain Symbol" </strong> the Polytechnic Museum in Moscow now stores the camera "Change-Symbol". Why did he “deserve” such an attitude? The fact is that it was it that was used by Soviet climbers when they climbed Mount Everest in 1982. And what’s most amazing - this camera is still working! </p>
 <p> • <strong> “Modestly and tastefully”: </strong> as a rule, photographers “catch” other people in their lenses. But, it turns out, the idea of ​​creating the first self-portrait also occurred to someone - and this "someone" turned out to be American Matthew B. Brady. When a photographer is tired of photographing others - he ... took and photographed himself! </p>
 <p> • <strong> The Secret of the Sea Monster. </strong>
If these pictures were taken in our days, then the audience would blame Photoshop for everything, but this frame was taken on December 12, 1964 and then, it caused a lot of controversy and rumor. In 1964, Photoshop was gone, so people came up with their own explanations. <br>
Robert Le Serre and his wife rested off the coast of Stonehaven Bay, near Hook Island, Queensland. His wife noticed an unusual large object underwater and they took some photos. According to the descriptions of the pair, the object resembled a giant tadpole, about 2.5 meters long. The object did not move, and the couple decided that the tadpole might be dead, so they came closer. Then the creature began to move, and they ran away, and an unknown object swam away. </p>
 <p> • <strong> The first photographs underwater </strong> were taken by William Thomas in 1856. Unfortunately, all the frames of that year were lost. Below is the first published underwater image (Louis Bhutan, 1890). </p>
 

 <p> • <strong> The first image from space </strong> was obtained in New Mexico. On October 24, 1946, a 35mm camera mounted on a V-2 rocket took a picture from a height of 65 miles above the Earth. Nowadays, we are accustomed to colorful pictures of NASA, video frames from Earth orbit. And then, in the forty-sixth, when the war was just over, it was an unprecedented miracle to see this. </p>
 
 <p> • <strong> Mysterious astronaut. </strong> <br>
When Jim Templeton took photographs of his wife and daughter on a sunny day in Cumbria, England, in the summer of 1964, he did not know what would cause a lot of debate among the conspiracy theorists and UFOs. After shooting, the photographer showed the film and took photographs, he found that behind the back of his little daughter is a silhouette of a man in a spacesuit. Templeton said that during the shooting, he did not see anyone except his wife and daughter. When the picture became public, some viewers said that the astronaut was behind, this is nothing more than the mother of the girl standing behind her. The rest suggested that it was an astronaut who landed in the same area. </p>

 

 <p> • <strong> Photos of the far side of the moon. </strong> <br>
It is a well-known fact that humanity always sees the satellite of the Earth on one side. But what is hiding on the other side of the moon? Below is a photograph taken by Apollo 17 during the last flight to the moon. <br>
 
Despite the granularity of the frame, it clearly shows the image of a certain pointed mountain or pyramid. Some believe that these are the Great Pyramids, similar to the Egyptian ones. NASA does not disclose the history of the origin of the frame and does not specify what exactly is depicted on it. </p>
