<p> • People could create images on a wall or a sheet of paper, but photo printing was not possible at that time, since saving a light image was more difficult than projecting it. The tool used for working with images was called the “Obscura Camera” (which means “dark room” in Latin) and it existed several centuries before the photo appeared. <br>
It is believed that the pinhole camera was invented around the XIII-XIV centuries, but the chronicles of the Arab scholar Hassan ibn Hassan, X century, described the principles of the pinhole camera, on which the analog photo was ultimately based. A rather primitive, but at the same time sophisticated device is a pinhole camera. The principle of operation is that, passing through a hole on the front of the device, the sun's rays create an image on the screen. At the same time, it will turn upside down. <br>
 
Further, the camera obscura more and more improved: lenses were added to it, first to increase the viewing angle, then to improve image clarity. Instead of stationary, it has become more mobile and smaller. </p>



 <div> • <strong> The first photo </strong>, as far as we know, was taken in 1825 by the French inventor Joseph Nieps. She depicts a view from a window in Le Gras. The picture is called: “View from the window on Le Gras”. To create this image, Joseph Nieps smeared a metal plate with a thin layer of asphalt and set it for eight hours in the sun in a pinhole camera. After eight hours of exposure, an image of the visible landscape from the window appeared on the plate. So the very first photo in the world appeared. This image has little artistic value besides the fact that this is the first photograph ever taken and reached us. Of course, there is no composition in this photograph, since at that time the photograph was not considered as art, but as a technical innovation.
 
Ten years ago, this image was taken over by the French National Library. </div>
 <p> • In 1839, Sir John Herschel found a way to make the first glass negative instead of metal. In the same year he coined the term “Photography”, derived from Greek words meaning “light” and “write”. Despite the fact that the process has become simpler and the result is better, it took a lot of time for the photo to become widely known. </p>
                                                                              

 <p> • <strong> The very first color photo </strong> was taken in 1861 by the English mathematician physicist James Clerk Maxwell. The photo is called "Plaid Ribbon."
In 1901, the Kodak Brownie camera was introduced, becoming the first commercial camera on the market available to the middle class. The camera took only black and white pictures, but was very popular due to its efficiency and ease of use. Color photography, despite the fact that it was developed during the 19th century, did not find commercial expression until the middle of the 20th century. Scientists at the beginning of the century could not keep the color long enough, it disappeared over time due to imperfect recipes. Several methods of color photography were patented in 1862 by two French inventors who worked independently of each other: Louis Ducos du Oron and Charles Cros.
As a result, the first working color photographic plate appeared on the market in 1907. The method used in it was based on a screen of filters. The screen allows you to filter red, green and / or blue light. The photographic plate was then treated to obtain a positive image. Using the same screen during photo printing allowed you to get a color photo. This technology, slightly modified, is still used. Red, green and blue are the primary colors for television and computer screens, and the RGB (red + green + blue) mode in many graphics applications is associated with this. </p>

Instant photography is a kind of analog photography that allows you to get ready-made positive images in a few minutes without processing in a darkroom. The first patent for a camera suitable for instant photography was obtained in 1923 by Samuel Schlafrock. The device was a cumbersome combination of a shooting camera and a portable darkroom, only slightly reducing the time to get the finished negative. The solution to the problem was photographic materials of complex design with integrated photographic reagents and the ability to immediately get positive. Their development was started by Agfa in the late 1930s, but the mass production was launched by Polaroid only in November 1948, simultaneously with the advent of the Polaroid Land 95 camera.
 

The patent for a photo process with image transfer was registered by the company's founder Edwin Land in 1947. In the future, the name of the company Polaroid, which had almost exclusive rights to produce photographic materials of a single-stage photographic process, became synonymous with instant photography. In the USSR, attempts were made to produce similar photo sets for the Moment (1952-1954) and Photon (1969-1976) cameras. But these models were not popular due to the shortage of photo materials of the corresponding type

 <p> • <strong> Digital Photography </strong> <br>
Modern photography technology, which began in 1969, when researchers Willard Boyle and George Smith formulated the idea of ​​a charge-coupled device (CCD) for recording images]. The first experimental filmless camera, based on photovoltaic conversion, was created in 1975 by Eastman Kodak engineer Steven Sassoon. The CCD matrix used in it had a resolution of 0.01 megapixels, and data was recorded on a compact cassette. The first consumer-grade digital camera in 1988 was the Fuji DS-1P, which uses a removable SRAM card for recording. In the same year, Kodak created the first Electro-Optic Camera digital SLR camera based on the Canon New F-1 small format camera. Recording of the data was carried out by a separate VCR connected to the camera by cable. <br>
 
As a result of cooperation between Nikon and Kodak, in August 1994, a Kodak DCS 410 hybrid digital camera was created based on the Nikon F90 camera, the removable back cover of which was replaced by a 1.5 megapixel CCD attachment. The data was recorded on a PCMCIA card built into the digital back]. In March 1998, the first all-in-one Canon EOS D2000 SLR camera appeared on the market. All these samples were intended for photo services of news information agencies and cost from 15 to 30 thousand dollars. The cheapest cameras, such as the Canon EOS D30, released in 2000, exceeded $ 2,500, remaining unacceptable to most photographers. <br>
The breakthrough occurred in 2003, when the Canon EOS 300D amateur SLR camera appeared on the market, the cost of which first fell below the psychological mark of $ 1,000. <br>
 
During the existence of photography, many technologies for obtaining images have appeared, often very different from each other, and providing completely different results. As with other visual arts, these technologies are called “techniques.” </p>
 <p> • <strong> Taking photos with your smartphone. </strong> <br>
In connection with the development of mobile technologies, budget cameras began to fade into the background, as photos of not worse quality can be taken using a mobile phone’s camera. In this article we will tell you how to take pictures on your mobile phone. </p>

      
 <p> Like any “large” camera, the smartphone’s camera consists of several blocks: <br>
• lens; <br>
• shutter; <br>
• matrix; <br>
• loops. </p>

 <p> The two main components of the smartphone’s camera are the matrix and the optical lens system. The matrix is ​​a rectangular-shaped element on which millions of photosensitive diodes are invisible to the naked eye, which are responsible for fixing the image. <br>
But diodes are unable to do this without another important element - a color filter. Before reaching the photodetectors of the matrix, the luminous flux passes through three filters of the RGB system: red, green and blue (hence the name of this color model). Therefore, each photosensitive cell is able to recognize only a third of the color information received on it. Only one color (e.g. red). The rest does not pass through the filter, but it is perceived by neighboring diodes. It comes to them through other color filters (green or blue). The processor is engaged in processing the received information, it also generates the final value of the color pixel, taking into account data from several photosensitive cells. <br>

One million pixels = one megapixel. And of course, the more megapixels, the more points will form the final image and the more detailed each photo will turn out. <br>

The most widely used cameras among smartphones are CMOS matrices. They consume a minimum of battery power and allow faster formation of the final image file. The pixel of such a matrix can be equipped with an amplifier, which will improve the result of shooting in poor light. <br>

The photo quality is also affected by the size of each photodetector separately and the matrix as a whole. The larger the pixel, the more light it is able to capture. Everything is simple here: 1.4 microns is better than 1.12 microns. But with the size of the matrix itself, the situation is a little more interesting. The larger it is, the easier it is to fit on it a lot of large-sized pixels, while observing a certain distance between them. And the farther the pixels from each other, the less digital noise in the photo. </p>

 <p> • <strong> Lens. </strong> <br>
Before light filters reach the photodetectors of the matrix, the light flux passes through the lenses of the lens. In modern smartphones, there can be five or eight, but they are always located in a certain sequence. Everything is serious, almost the same as in professional devices. </p>

 <p> The shutter of the smartphone’s camera is not physical, but digital. If the lens opens and closes with a special device in the SLR camera, the program does this on the phone. The shutter fires at different speeds depending on the lighting, so the image is clear or blurry. <br>
From the smartphone’s camera there is a loop to its main boards, which are responsible for image processing and storage. So, we see that the “camera” in your phone is not so small: to some extent, the entire smartphone is part of it. A modern phone is generally very miniature, and the blocks in it are stacked closely. Therefore, repairing smartphones is a more complicated and painstaking task than, for example, repairing laptops. </p>

 <p> • <strong> Videos. </strong> <br>

 With video shooting, everything is as unobvious as with the question of the number of megapixels. The resolution of the video is not the only thing that affects its final quality. Two other parameters should be noted - FPS and bit rate. <br>

 FPS - the number of frames per second. The higher this value, the smoother the video will be. And the higher the bitrate, the better the image quality inside the video. And to achieve maximum performance immediately in three ways (resolution, FPS, bit rate) few smartphones can. Here, everything depends heavily on the software capabilities of the smartphone, and unlike the maximum shooting resolution, other parameters, although not hidden by the manufacturers, are not advertised. You can recognize them either by rummaging on the Web, or by filming a couple of test videos as part of a test drive of your favorite model. <br>

 For all lovers of photo and video, and there are many, the presence of a flash in a mobile device is no less important than the presence of the camera itself. Using the flash allows you to shoot in low light conditions: in a dark room, during twilight or at night. It creates the necessary lighting and compensates for the lack of natural light. </p>
