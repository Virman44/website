<p> • <strong> The principle of obtaining a photographic image. <br>
Daggerotype: </strong> <br>
A polished silver plate was exposed to iodine vapor in the dark. A plaque of silver iodine appeared on it. The plate was transferred to a pinhole camera, the lens was opened. Under the influence of sunlight falling on the plate, reflected by photographed objects, a barely visible “hidden” image was obtained in a layer of silver iodide. The plate was removed from the chamber and treated in the dark with vapors of heated mercury. In places exposed to light, an amalgam was obtained. These places in tone now noticeably differed from sections of the plate that were not exposed to light rays. Excess silver iodide that was not exposed to light was then removed with sodium chloride solution (later hyposulfite was used); in this way a light-painting image was fixed. To capture a view on a silver plate, at least in general terms, a shutter speed of tens of minutes was needed. It was practically impossible to shoot portraits. To photograph a person, his face was “whitened” with chalk, and his hair was sprinkled with powder - then more rays of light reflected from the face and hair fell into the pinhole camera. But even so, he had to sit in front of the camera in the sun for a long time. <br>
The drawing on the silver plate was hard to see: the specular brilliance of the image unpleasantly hit. Only at a certain angle sometimes not all of the image, but only part of it could be considered. The silver plate on which the daguerreotype was shot was expensive. Lessons in writing turned out to be accessible to few. In addition, the image was very fragile, it was easily erased at the slightest touch and was mirrored rather than direct </p>

<p> <strong> Now: </strong> <br>
The image in the camera is obtained using a photographic lens, giving the inverse of the actual image of the subject. The lens consists of a system of centered lenses and aperture, enclosed in a common frame. In addition to lenses, some lenses also have a mirror system. <br>
The positive-negative process began with Talbot's experiments and improved over time. Its advantage over daguerreotypes is that two-stage printing allows you to reproduce photographic images, while daguerreotypes are obtained in one copy. On paper prints, the right side of the photographic object remained right, and the left - left. On the daguerreotype, the image was mirrored. And besides, two-step printing is much cheaper. <br>
<p> <strong> Negative </strong> - in black and white photography and cinematography, the image of the subject formed by grains of metallic silver, in which the blackening is inverse to the brightness of the object's details: the brighter the detail, the greater the blackening it is reproduced; in color - the image of the subject, formed by dyes whose colors are complementary to the colors of its details: yellow to blue, purple to green, blue to red and so on. An intermediate image of an object in a two-stage process used to get positive. In some cases, the negative can be the final image, for example, when recording spectra in a spectral analysis. The quality of the negative is evaluated by the optical density of blackening, contrast, graininess. For color negatives, in addition, the balance of colors, that is, the coordination of color images, is important. A negative is considered normal, typing from which provides a plausible positive with clearly distinguishable details. </p>
<p> <strong> Negative process </strong> is a chemical-technological process in which a latent image that occurs in the photosensitive layer of the photographic material during shooting is converted into a visible image - negative. At N. p., The exposed photosensitive material undergoes a photographic manifestation - the selective restoration of microcrystals of silver halide exposed to light into grains of metallic silver, which form a negative image; in color photographic material based on an image of metallic silver, an image of dyes appears. </p>
<p> <strong> Photographic manifestation </strong> - the conversion of a latent photographic image that has arisen in the photosensitive layer of film and photo materials under the influence of light or other radiation into visible. <br>
In a “chemical” manifestation, silver is reduced from silver halides of emulsion crystals of the photosensitive layer; in the “physical” manifestation - from a soluble silver salt (usually AgNO3), which is part of the developer. F. p. Is an election process, the speed of which on the exposed sections of the photosensitive layer is much higher than on unexposed ones. <br>
N. p. Includes photographic fixation — the conversion of silver halides remaining after the manifestation into soluble salts, washing — removing soluble substances with water, drying — removing water from photographic material. If necessary, to correct a negative image, the photographic material is subjected to photographic attenuation — the process of reducing the optical density of the photographic image by removing part of the metallic silver from it (for black and white photographic materials); selective partial bleaching of blue, yellow or purple tones (for multilayer color photographic materials). This allows us to improve the quality of overexposed and re-developed negatives, however, it is not possible to completely compensate for exposure errors and manifestations of the photographic. Also, photographic material can be subjected to photographic enhancement - the process of increasing the optical density of a photographic image to correct mostly underexposed or underdeveloped negatives. It is carried out by building up metal (mercury, silver) or some opaque compound on silver grains of the image, as well as by coloring photographic images. <br>
N.'s operations can be performed both manually and in special machines. There are many ways to handle negatives. “Photoreceptive reference book for amateurs” by Mikulin. </p>
<p> <strong> Negative Processing Components: </strong> <br>
• showing; <br>
• preserving; <br>
• accelerating; <br>
• antiviral agent (so that the emulsion is more transparent); <br>
• fixing. </p>
<p> <strong> Positive </strong> - the final product of the photographic process - a photographic image in which the relative distribution of brightness (black and white photo) or color (color photo) corresponds to their distribution in the subject, i.e. colors match the colors of the photographed subject. This positive is the opposite of the negative, in which the inverse distribution of brightness or image transmission in complementary colors. There are positives - prints on photographic materials with an opaque substrate (paper, ceramics, etc.) and on materials with a transparent substrate (glass, films, etc.), i.e. transparencies and film positives intended for viewing in transmitted light or for projection to the screen. You can get a lot of positives from one negative. </p>
<p> <strong> Positive process </strong> - a set of operations that allow you to get a positive image from a negative. The item of item consists of printing (exhibiting) and chemical-photographic processing of the exposed material. Printing with negative can be done in two ways: contact and projection (optical). In contact printing, the emulsion of positive material is tightly pressed to the emulsion of the negative and exposed to the light passing through the negative. Therefore, a positive image is obtained on the same scale as the negative, and has the inherent sharpness and resolution of small details in the negative. Printing is done in copy frames, contact machines and film copiers. <br>
Projection printing is carried out by projecting a negative image onto an emulsion of positive material located at a certain distance from the negative using a lens. This makes it possible to widely change the image scale, print part of the negative, eliminate perspective distortions and make photo montages by combining several images in one positive. Processing of exposed positive materials on the physicochemical nature of the processes does not differ from the processing of negative materials.
